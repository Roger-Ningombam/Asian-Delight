    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
        At Asian Delight, food is more than a meal – it’s a way of bringing family and community together. Our story began with a simple vision: to share the authentic flavors of Asia that have been passed down through generations in our family kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
        From fragrant stir-fries to slow-simmered curries and handcrafted dumplings, every dish is made with care, using fresh ingredients and recipes inspired by traditions from across the region. What started as family gatherings filled with laughter, stories, and home-cooked meals has grown into a restaurant where we invite you to become part of our extended family.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you’re here for a quick bite, a cozy dinner with loved ones, or a celebration, Asian Delight is a place where warmth, hospitality, and flavor come together. Our mission is simple: to serve food that delights your taste buds and makes you feel at home.
    </p>
    <p>
        Welcome to our table – welcome to Asian Delight.
